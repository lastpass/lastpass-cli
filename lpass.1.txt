Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '--sync' options control when the current operation involves a
synchronization with the server. If 'now' is set, and the command makes a
change, the change is synchronized before the command exits. If 'now' is set,
and the command displays a value, the local cache is synchronized before the
value is shown. If 'now' is set, and the command is otherwise successful, but
synchronization fails, the command will return an error. If 'auto' is set,
and the command makes a change, the change is synchronized to the server in
the background. If 'auto' is set, and the command displays a value, the local
cache is synchronized before the value is shown only if the local cache is
more than 5 seconds (or 'LPASS_AUTO_SYNC_TIME' seconds, if set) old. If 'no'
is set, the command will not interact with the server, unless there is a
current upload queue being processed. Any local changes that are not
synchronized with the server will exist in a queue of timestamped requests
which will be synchronized on the next occurring synchronization.

The 'sync' command forces a synchronization of the local cache with the
LastPass servers, and does not exit until the local cache is synchronized or
until an error occurs. Alternatively, if '--background' is specified, the
synchronization occurs in a daemonized process.

Agent
~~~~~
An agent process will be spawned in the background on a first successful
command, and all subsequent commands will use the agent for decryption,
instead of asking a user for a password. The agent will quit after one hour,
unless the 'LPASS_AGENT_TIMEOUT' environment variable is set to an alternative
number of seconds in which to quit, or 0 to never quit. If the environment
variable 'LPASS_AGENT_DISABLE' is set to 1, the agent will not be used.

Password Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *pinentry* program, part of *gpg2*(1), may be used for inputting
passwords if it is installed. A custom path to the *pinentry* program can be
provided by the 'LPASS_PINENTRY' environment variable.

If *pinentry* program is unavailable, or if the 'LPASS_DISABLE_PINENTRY'
environment variable is set to 1, passwords will be read from standard input and a
prompt will be displayed on standard error.

The program used for inputting passwords may also be configured by setting the
'LPASS_ASKPASS' environment variable. 'LPASS_ASKPASS' is expected to be a
binary that produces a prompt using its first command-line argument, and
outputs the entered password to standard out.  ssh-askpass implements this
protocol, as does the following shell script:

[verse]
 #!/bin/bash
 echo -n "$*: " >/dev/stderr
 stty -echo
 read answer
 stty echo
 echo $answer

Entry Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commands that take a 'UNIQUENAME' will fail if the provided name is used
multiple times, and return an error. Commands may alternatively take a
'UNIQUEID', which will be the integer 'ID' provided by LastPass for identifying
entries uniquely. Commands that take either a 'NAME' or a 'UNIQUEID' will create a
new entry if a 'NAME' is specified and otherwise overwrite an existing entry if
'UNIQUEID' is specified.

Logging In
~~~~~~~~~~
The 'login' subcommand will initialize a local cache and configuration folder,
then attempt to authenticate itself with the LastPass servers, using the
provided command line credentials or by interactively prompting (in the case of
multifactor or an unprovided password). The '--trust' option will cause
subsequent logins to not require multifactor authentication. If the
'--plaintext-key' option is specified, the decryption key will be saved to the
hard disk in plaintext.  Please note that use of this option is discouraged
except in limited situations, as it greatly decreases the security of data.

The 'logout' subcommand will remove the local cache and stored encryption
keys. It will prompt the user to confirm, unless '--force' is specified.

The 'passwd' subcommand may be used to change your LastPass password:
it will prompt for the old and new password and then re-encrypt all records
with the newly derived key.

Viewing
~~~~~~~
The 'show' subcommand will display a password or selected field.

By default, the site you specify with the 'show' subcommand must
*exactly* match the name of the site.  If the '--fixed-strings' or '-F'
option is set, then the 'show' subcommand will find a site containing
that *exact* substring; if the '--basic-regexp' or '-G' option is set,
then the 'show' subcommand will find a site matching a case-insensitive
regular expression.

By default if your 'show' subcommand matches more than one site, then
the 'show' subcommand will generate a warning and display the names of
matching sites but no other information.  The '--expand-multi' or '-x'
option will instead show the requested information from all of the
matching sites.

The 'ls' subcommand will list names in groups in a tree structure. If
the '--long' or '-l' option is set, then also list the last modification
time.  The '-u' option may be passed to show the last use (last touch) time
instead, if available. Both times are in GMT.

Passing '--json' to 'show' will generate json output instead of
human-readable text.

In addition to using the built-in formats, both 'show' and 'ls' subcommands
support printf-style format strings by using the '--format' option with
the following placeholders:

* %ai: account id
* %an: account name
* %aN: account name including path
* %au: account user
* %ap: account password
* %am: account modification time
* %aU: account last touch time
* %as: account share name
* %ag: account group name
* %al: account URL
* %fn: field name (for 'show')
* %fv: field value (for 'show')

A slash can be added between the '%' and the placeholder to indicate that a
slash should be appended, only if the printed value is expanded to a non-empty
string.  For example, this command will properly show the full path to
an account: `lpass ls --format="%/as%/ag%an"`.

Modifying
~~~~~~~~~
The 'edit' subcommand will edit the selected field. If '--non-interactive' is not
set, the selected field will be edited using 'EDITOR'; otherwise the command will
accept data until EOF or, unless the notes field is being edited, the first new line.
Please note that when editing interactively, the contents of the field may be
saved on disk in tmp files or in editor swap files, depending on your system
configuration.

The 'generate' subcommand will create a randomly generated password for the
chosen key name, and optionally add a url and username while inserting the
generated password.

The 'rm' command will remove the specified entry, and the 'duplicate' command
will create a duplicate entry of the one specified, but with a different 'ID'.

Backup
~~~~~~
The 'export' subcommand will dump all account information including
passwords to stdout (unencrypted) in CSV format.  The optional
'--fields=FIELDLIST' argument may contain a comma-separated subset of the
following fields:

  id, url, username, password, extra, name, fav, id, grouping, group,
  fullname, last_touch, last_modified_gmt, attachpresent

The 'import' subcommand does the reverse: accounts from an unencrypted
CSV file are uploaded to the server.

It is recommended that such backups be encrypted at rest, for example by
piping to and from gpg.

Shared Folder Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'share' command and its accompanying subcommands can be used to manipulate
shared folders, if available to the (enterprise or premium) user.  The
'userls', 'useradd', 'usermod', and 'userdel' subcommands may be used to
query and modify membership of the shared folder, while the 'create' and 'rm'
share subcommands may be used to add new, or delete existing shared folders.
The normal 'generate' and 'edit' commands may be used to edit accounts within
the shared folder.

The 'share limit' command may be used to manipulate account access lists on the
share for a specific user.  Running with no arguments will display the
current access levels for a user.  The '--add', '--rm', and '--clear' options
may be used to add to, remove from, or reset the list.  Passing '--allow' or
'--deny' will make the list a whitelist or blacklist, respectively.

Confirming Sharing Keys When Sharing Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unauthorized access to your shared folder can be obtained by consuming a rogue
public key from compromised Lastpass servers. To defend against this, you
can choose to confirm the public key that is about to be used for 'share useradd'.

First, 'login' as the sharee, and invoke 'status -k' to print the sharee's public
key fingerprint.

Then, 'login' as the sharer, and invoke the 'share useradd -k' command.
The '-k' flag will print the public key fingerprint of the sharee and
will require manual confirmation to actually share the folder. Confirm that the
displayed fingerprint is the one that was shown during 'status -k' for the sharee.

Set environment variable `LPASS_ALWAYS_CONFIRM_KEYS` to 1 to force key confirmation.

Clipboard
~~~~~~~~~
Commands that take a '-c' or '--clip' option will copy the output to the
clipboard, using *xclip*(1) or *xsel*(1) on X11-based systems, *pbcopy*(1)
on OSX, or *putclip* on Cygwin. The command to be used can be overridden by
specifying the `LPASS_CLIPBOARD_COMMAND` environment variable.

Color Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '--color' option controls colored output to the terminal.  By default,
commands will use '--color=auto', in which color output is used unless the
output is not a tty (for example, when passed to a pipe or file).  If 'always'
is used, colors are produced regardless of the output detection.  If 'never'
is used, no color escape sequences are emitted.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'lpass' stores configuration in the following locations, in descending
order of precedence:

* The directory '$LPASS_HOME', if set
* '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lpass', '$XDG_DATA_HOME/lpass', and
  '$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lpass' (or equivalent defaults), if at least
  '$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR' is set
* '$HOME/.lpass'

All configuration may be specified via environment variables. Alternatively, a
set of environment variable overrides may be specified in '$LPASS_HOME/env' in
the form of:

[verse]
VARIABLE1=VALUE1
VARIABLE2=VALUE2
...

Aliases
~~~~~~~
Default options can be specified for any command by creating command aliases.
Command aliases are stored in the configuration directory (see previous
section) with files named 'alias.*command*'.  For example, to force the
'ls' subcommand to never use color, make an 'alias.ls' file with the
appropriate option:
----
echo 'ls --color=never' > ~/.config/lpass/alias.ls
----

Similarly, new subcommands can be created based on built-in subcommands with
options.  Thus,
----
echo 'show --password -c' > ~/.config/lpass/alias.passclip
----

would create a 'passclip' subcommand that copies your password onto the
clipboard.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The following environment variables may be used for configuration as described
in the section above:

* 'LPASS_HOME'
* 'LPASS_AUTO_SYNC_TIME'
* 'LPASS_AGENT_TIMEOUT'
* 'LPASS_AGENT_DISABLE'
* 'LPASS_PINENTRY'
* 'LPASS_DISABLE_PINENTRY'
* 'LPASS_ASKPASS'
* 'LPASS_CLIPBOARD_COMMAND'
* 'LPASS_LPASS_ALWAYS_CONFIRM_KEYS'
